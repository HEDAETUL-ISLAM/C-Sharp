For all HTML elements except PRE, sequences of white space separate "words" 
(we use the term "word" here to mean "sequences of non-white space characters"). 
hen formatting text, user agents should identify these words and lay them out 
according to the conventions of the particular written language (script) and target medium.

This layout may involve putting space between words (called inter-word space),
but conventions for inter-word space vary from script to script. For example, 
n Latin scripts, inter-word space is typically rendered as an ASCII space (&#x0020;), 
while in Thai it is a zero-width word separator (&#x200B;).
 In Japanese and Chinese, inter-word space is not typically rendered at all.



Statement text can be specified in the PREPARE statement
as a quoted string
or as text that is stored in an ESQL/C program variable
or (in SPL routines) as a character expression.
The following restrictions apply to the statement text:
The text can contain only SQL statements. It cannot contain statements or comments from the host programming language.
The text can contain comments preceded by a double hyphen (--), or that are enclosed in braces ( { } ) or in C-style 
slash and asterisk ( /* */ ) delimiters.
These symbols introduce or enclose SQL comments. For more information on SQL comment symbols, see How to Enter SQL Comments.
